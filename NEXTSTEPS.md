### Suggestions
 - The colliders, rather than just being targeted at you, could orbit you.
 - Then you would need to collide them with each-other, or shake them off
   using the gravity of a larger body
 - When they collide with each-other, maybe they split into less dangerous smaller colliders
 - Two words: Ablative Armor
