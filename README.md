Balls!
======

Playing with physics in LOVE2D.

I made this game in about 10 hours for the warm-up round of LD29.

### Instructions

If you need instructions to play a videogame, then you came to the right place!
Play Balls by trying to avoid the balls on the screen that aren't you. Don't
wander off the edge of the screen, because that would suck. Press 'SPACE' at
any time to restart; never press 'ESCAPE', because that would end the game.

### Distributions

You should just be able to download these and run them. Maybe on Linux you will need to also install love.
